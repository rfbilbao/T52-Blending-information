These csv files contain the list of the first 20 ranked members from best (at top) and worst (bottom) historical simulation members for each DCPP member. One file is produced per startdate (i.e. sXXX).

For example, 'BSC-DPPB_TSS_tos_s1961_Global_cFYrs1-10_centered.csv' contains ranked members per based on the centered Taylor skill score (Taylor et al., 2001), analogs are identified based on global sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly fields, a ten-year temporal aggregation is applied.

The file 'DCPP_members.csv' contains the list of DCPP members in order.

This method is intended to blend decadal predictions and historical simulations at forecast year 10.
